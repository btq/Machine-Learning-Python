# Machine-Learning-Python
Machine Learning topics explored in python (without ML libraries)

I put this together to further explore the methods behind ML algortithms. Sklearn is a great toolkit, but it helps to know what each function is actually doing under the hood.

Topics to be covered:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Anomaly Detection
* Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines
* Recommender Systems
